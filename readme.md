# Tic Tac Toe #

This is a simple game. Everyone can play it and knows how to.

I made it a bit more complicated than I had to and I'm currently working on a more simple version.
(You can find that [here](https://github.com/DionPotkamp/TicTacToeLite "Tic Tac Toe lite") when it's available)

Some settings are changeable and can be found under the gear in the bottom-right of the schreen.
  
## How it works ##

In the code ([game.js](game.js)) I added documentation where I try to clarify my code.
